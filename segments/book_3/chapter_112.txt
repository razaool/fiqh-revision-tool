The imamate of a bedouin(desert dweller)and the child from fornication is
disliked as well as the imamate of an ignorant person. The reason for their dislike
is due to the reduced numbers they will attract. A bedouin most of the time is
ignorant, whereas the child resulting from fornication in this case means an
ignorant person with no knowledge and lacking discipline because of his father's


absence.
