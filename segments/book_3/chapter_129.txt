Yawning and closing the eyes in prayer is disliked. The Prophet((God bless him
and grant him peace))said[If one of you stands in prayer, he should not shut his
eyes}." Also, Abu Hurairah((God be pleased with him))reported the Prophet((God grant him blessings and peace))saying[Yawning is from Satan and if
anyone of you yawns, he should check his yawning as much as possible, for if
anyone of you(during the act of yawning)should say 'ha', Satan will laugh at
him]."
