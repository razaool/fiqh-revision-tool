١٩٤ BOOK II: PRAYER





dubs pp ley


To pray within a short proximity of filth is disliked since we are ordered to


distance ourselves from filth and its place.
geal hte We Wiles


To resist the urge of urination or defecation in prayer or to resist the urge of
breaking wind is disapproved. The Prophet((Peace and blessings of God be upon
him))said[It is not permissible for a man who believes in Allah and the last day
to perform the prayer while he is feeling the call of nature until he becomes
light].


Vprbad Os Vi ye del Ped SO gb GE ١B]VJ Sule pe Lobes ary


To pray with excusable filth upon one's clothes or body is disliked unless one fears
he will miss the prayer time or the congregational prayer, because to miss the
obligatory prayer from its time is unlawful and to offer the prayer in congregation
is an established sunna at least, though if one does not fear this, then it is
preferable to remove the filth. Note: this type of filth is that which does not
prevent the prayer from being valid.

To pray with the head uncovered is disapproved except if one does so out of
humility and humbleness to God.

Offering the prayer in the presence of food that one has desire for, is disliked on
the basis of distraction. Furthermore, anything that distracts the mind and
reduces concentration is disliked.

To count the verses of Quran on the hand as well as the éasbth is disapproved,
though Imam Muhammad and Abu Yusuf held that it is not disliked. Regardless
of these different views, if one counts with the tongue, prayer is void according to
all jurists.
