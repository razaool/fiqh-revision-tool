It is wajib for the midwife(or nurse)to cut off prayer if she fears the death of a


child or its mother. If she has not started the prayer, then there is no harm in
delaying the prayer and attending to the child or mother.

The Ruling Of One Who Neglects Prayer


Lao Lb Vasarely ame ١٣١ Y!


The one who intentionally neglects prayer due to laziness or idleness, is to be
beaten harshly until blood flows from his body and is then imprisoned during
which he is subject to physical pain, until he performs his prayers or dies in
confinement. This ruling also applies for one who does not fast Ramadan due to
laziness, i.e. he is beaten and imprisoned. However, one is not to be killed for
leaving prayer or fasting due to idleness, unless he rejects the belief that prayer
and Ramadan are obligatory or unless he belittles either one of them.
