٤٤ BOOK I: PURIFICATION


It is disapproved to urinate or defecate in a hole, on a road or a cemetery as the
Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))said: "Fear the two that are
cursed." They inquired, "Who are those that are cursed O Messenger of Allah?"
He said, "The one that relieves himself in the road or walkway of the people or in
their shade."!

To relieve oneself under a fruit tree is disapproved.

To urinate standing is disliked unless there is a reason, such as an injured back. It
is also disliked to urinate in the place of wudu due to the onset of satanic whispers
which may be brought on by such a practice and because there is prohibition
from exposing the private parts whilst standing as Anas(Allah be pleased with
him)said[If the Prophet wanted to attend to a need, he would not lift his clothes
until he was close to the ground]."


* One is to exit the lavatory with the right leg because it has more right to be
advanced when exiting such a place.

- One is then to say, "All praise be to Allah, the One who has repelled harm from me and
protected me." And the Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))said at the
time of exiting[I ask your forgiveness].'
