BOOK II: PRAYER ٢٤٩


Reciting a letter of the word 'sajda' with the word before it or the word after, from
the verses which require prostration, is regarded as recitation of the entire verse
and one must therefore prostrate according to the soundest view. Though it has
been mentioned that one is not required to prostrate unless he recites the majority
of the verse of prostration. Additionally, it is held in the book MukAtasar al-Bahar.
that if a person recites the word "Wasjud" - which means — but prostrate, and then
pauses and does not recite the word "Waktarib" — which means; and bring yourself
closer, then he is required to prostrate.
