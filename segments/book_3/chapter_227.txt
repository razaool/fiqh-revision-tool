A person who vows I'tikaf for a certain number of nights must also observe the
days consecutively even if a consecutive order is not stipulated when vowing. And
this is the most evident view on the matter. The basis for this is that /'tikafis built
upon a consecutive order in that it continues through the night and day, though
this is contrary to a fast which is built upon separation in that the nights are not
acceptable for the fast. Thus, fasts are obligatory with separation even if the person
expressly stipulates a consecutive order.'

A person who vaes two days in retreat must also remain for two nights. The reason
that the nights become binding with the days is because this person intended a
dual form which is a combination of both day and night in meaning. One is
therefore bound by the ruling as a precaution. One must therefore enter the
masjid a little time before the sun sets on the basis that the night precedes the day
and remain for two nights and two days.'

If a person forms an intention specifically for the days without the nights, it is
valid because it is directed towards the actual object.'

If one vows I'tikaf for a month(whether it is specified or not)and he intends the
days only or intends the nights only, then this intention cannot come into effect
unless he expresses what he wishes to rule out and exclude in his intention, such as
the saying, "One month in the day excluding the nights."
