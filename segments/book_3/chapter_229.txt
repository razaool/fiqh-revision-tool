'Ata ibn Abi Rabah stated the following: the example of a person in I"tikaf is like
the person who stands and waits on a great door(of a king, great minister or an
imam)because of a need he has. Equally, the person in /'tkaf utters, "J will not
leave and depart from the 'door' of my Maker until He has forgiven me my sins, which are the
reasons for the distance between me and Him and the descending of calamities upon me." 'Ata
ibn Abi Rabah was a tabi', a student of Ibn Abbas((God be pleased with him))and one of the teachers of Imam Abu Hanifa. Abu Hanifa said of him[I did not
see anyone greater in jurisprudence than Hammad and that there was no one
whom had gathered the entirety of knowledge more than 'Ata Ibn Abi Rabah].
Most of the narrations of Abu Hanifa were from 'Ata whom heard it from Ibn
Abbas and Ibn Umar, Abu Hurairah, Abu Sa'id, Jabir and A'ishah. He died in
١١٥ Hijrah and he was eighty years of age].
