The Chapter of Prayer


Linguistically, prayer means supplication, and according to Sacred law, it is
specific words and actions that begin with an opening takbir[Allahu akbar]and
end with finishing salams.


* Jabir related that the Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))said[The
link between a Muslim and disbelief is the neglect of prayer]Muslim.


« Buraydah, Allah be pleased with him, related that the Prophet((God bless him
and grant him peace))said[The bond between us that separates us from the rest
of human kind is prayer. Whoever neglects it will become a disbeliever]Ahmad
and Nasai.


On the basis of these hadith and others, Imam Ahmad Ibn Hanbal held that
whoever intentionally neglects prayer will become a disbeliever. Whereas Imam
Shafi'i held, such a person is to be given the death penalty, whilst he is still
regarded as a believer. Abu Hanifa held, that such a person is jailed indefinitely
or until he repents making up the prayers.

One is to order his children to pray at the age of seven, and hit them to pray at
the age of ten for neglecting prayer, with the hand not with the stick. The Prophet(God bless him and grant him peace)said, "Order your children to pray at the age
of seven, and discipline them at the age of ten, and separate their bedding(regarding their sleeping area}."" Note: hitting in this context does not mean to
injure or to inflict physical pain; rather it means to use sensible and reasonable
discipline. The Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))forbade the hitting
of the face and Allah said about the Prophet[You have not been sent except as a
mercy unto mankind].
