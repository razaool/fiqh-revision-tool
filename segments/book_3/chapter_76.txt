BOOK II: PRAYER ١٣١


CIEL Jy SUN Jars ey ot ٥٥ plab »٢>y


Prayer is disliked in the presence of food which one desires and craves for. In
addition, anything which distracts one's mind and reduces concentration in
prayer is disliked. A'ishah reported that the Prophet said[No prayer can be(rightly said)when the food is there before the worshipper, or when he is
prompted by the call of nature]."
