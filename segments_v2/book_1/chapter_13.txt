Sg AS pee MOU ys il dary ٥ pall abe A Jory


One is to enter the lavatory with the left foot and is to seek protection in Allah
from Satan the rejected before entering. The Prophet((God bless him and grant
him peace))said[The cover between the eyes of the jinn and the private parts of
the children of Adam is when the person enters the lavatory, he says, "In the
name of Allah"]." The Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))also said[The evil ones of the jinns are present, so if anyone enters the lavatory, he should
say, 'I seek refuge with Allah from the unclean spirits, male and female'}."

One is to sit leaning upon his left side and is not to talk unless there is a need.
The Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))said[When two persons go
together for relieving themselves uncovering their private parts and talking
together, Allah the Great and Majestic, becomes wrathful at this action].

It is prohibitively disliked to face the qibla at the time of relief and to turn around
giving it one's back even if the toilet is within a building. The Prophet((God bless
him and grant him peace))said[If the need to defecate arose, then do not face the
qibla, and do not turn around giving it your back, however turn east or west.'

To face the sun or moon directly is disliked because they are great signs of Allah's
creation.

To face a blowing wind is disliked at the time of relief because the filth is likely to
be blown back onto one's body or clothes.

It is disliked to urinate or defecate in water even if it is flowing, and the same
applies in a place of shade because it may be a rest area for other people.
