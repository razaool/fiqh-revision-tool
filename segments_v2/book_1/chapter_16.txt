The Chapter Of Wudu(Ablution)The Messenger of Allah(God bless him and grant him peace)said, "When a
person performs ablution and rinses his mouth, his wrong deeds fall from it. As
he rinses his nose, his wrong deeds fall from it. When he washes his face, his
wrong deeds fall from it until they fall from beneath his eyelashes. When he
washes his hands, his wrong deeds fall from them until they fall from beneath the
fingernails. When he wipes his head, his wrong deeds fall from it until they fall
from his ears. When he washes his feet, his wrong deeds fall from them until they
fall from beneath his toenails. Then his walking to the masjid and his prayer give
him extra reward."! Allah the exalted said in relation to wudu[O you who believe!


When you prepare for prayer wash your faces and your hands(and arms)to the
elbows; Rub your head(with water)and(wash)your feet to the ankles].'
