١/ To waste water is disliked, due to the words of the Prophet((God bless him and
grant him peace))to Sa'ad when he passed by him whilst he was making wudu[What is this wastage, O Sa'ad?]in which he replied: Is there wastage in wudu?
The Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))said[Yes, even if you were at
a flowing river]."

٢/ It is disliked to use very little water to the extent that one uses hardly enough
that it nearly becomes like wiping. The Prophet((God bless him and grant him
peace))said[The best of matters is the middle course].'

٣/ To slap water on the face is disliked for the reason that the face has honour,
and it should be performed gently, as the Prophet((God bless him and grant him
peace))said((Do not hit the face)).'


٤/ To speak words of general speech, namely, that which is devoid of the
remembrance of God, is disliked as it entails distraction from supplication.

٥/ To seek assistance from others without a reason is disliked. Umar((Allah be
pleased with him))said: I saw the Prophet((God bless him and give him peace))pouring water to make wudu, so I moved so that I could prepare that for him
when he said to me, "Stop, O Umar - for verily ١ do not need anyone to help me
with my prayers."*

٦/ To wipe the head three times using new water each time is disliked, because
wiping is only performed once.
