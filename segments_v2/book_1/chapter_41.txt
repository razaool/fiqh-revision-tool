٥- The fifth condition requires one to wipe with the entire hand or the majority of
it. It is not valid if a person wipes with only two fingers even if he does so


repeatedly until the required area is covered. However, in wudu a person may
wipe his head with two fingers until he covers the required area, and this suffices.

٦- The sixth condition is that it must be with two strikes with the inside of the
palms over the soil, even if the two strikes are from the same place. An alternative
solution to the two strikes is the wiping of the soil(or earth)already present on
one's body, provided one intends tayammum when doing this. This situation
could arise by means of a dust storm where one is covered in sand. If this
occurred and one wiped the sand on his face and arms with the intention of
tayammun,, it is valid.


٧- The seventh condition stipulates that the things that are incompatible with


tayammum must discontinue before proceeding such as menstrual periods,
postnatal bleeding or minor impurity.

٨ The eighth condition that validates tayammum is to remove obstacles that
prevent the wiping of the skin, such as wax or fatty grease, because if one wipes
with these things present on the body, then he will in actual fact be wiping the
wax or fat and not the skin.

© gain gil g٨ S٩٠ LS ٤٣ ga y to)gal y Arseny
The reason for tayammum and the conditions that make it obligatory are the
same as wudu; namely, one cannot be legal for acts of worship unless he is pure.


Its conditions are sanity, maturity, Islam, being in a state of minor impurity, and
so forth.
