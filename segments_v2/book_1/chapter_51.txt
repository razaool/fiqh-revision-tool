If one's eye is infected and the physician orders him not to wash it, or one has
broken his nail and has applied medicine upon the injury or an aid or the skin of
an animal for healing, the removal of which is harmful, then it is permissible to
wipe over the medicine. If however, it will cause harm to wipe over the medicine,
then it is permitted to omit the wiping.

One is not required to form an intention for wiping on the footgear[kAu/], splint,
and head. It is agreed among the scholars that a person is not required to have an
intention when wiping the splint or head, whereas for the wiping on the khuf, it is
evident that intention is not a stipulation although some scholars have stated that
it is.
