BOOK I: PURIFICATION ١١٣


Also, the skin that contains the musk is pure including the musk itself and it is
permissible to eat. This musk(or perfume)is found in the body of a deer, gazelle,
and antelope." The author added the permissibility of eating the musk because
there are many things which are regarded as pure, but they are not permitted to
eat such as soil. So he clarified the verdict in regards to eating the musk.

Civet is deemed pure. Civet is a strong smelling yellow substance secreted by a
civet cat and is used in the making of perfume. This substance, which is foam or
froth, is taken from a pouch under the tails of male and female civet cats. A civet
cat is a small spotted and stripped carnivorous mammal found in Asia and Africa.
Civet has a very strong smell and its scent is similar to musk, but has a more
smoky, sweaty aroma. It is permitted for one to pray whilst he is perfumed in it
for the reason that it has undergone transformation into an aroma. This is similar
to the musk found in a gazelle. And something that has undergone
transformation is regarded pure."
