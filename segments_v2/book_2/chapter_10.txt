EW bOI aT phe OLy WL ٥٥٨ Vo UY Gp ٢ OY G Seen


It is recommended for the caller to pronounce the adhan without haste by taking a
short pause between every two words, and to utter the igama speedily. It is not
permitted to call the adhan in Persian or any other language except Arabic, even
if it is known and evident that it is the adhan.

It is recommended that the caller be righteous since he is like a trustee of the


religion, and that he have knowledge in the sunan of adhan, and knowledge of the
prayer times.

It is recommended that the caller be in a state of ablution and that he face the
direction of prayer except if he is riding. It is recommended that he place his
fingers in his ears and turn his head(not the chest or feet)to the right when
saying 'come to prayer' and to the left when saying 'ome to success.' This is what the
Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))ordered Bilal to do.


In addition, it is recommended to revolve(or turn in a circular fashion)within the


minaret as one is calling the adhan so people in every direction can hear the
adhan.

It is recommended to allocate a sufficient amount of time between the adhan and


igama that allows the regular people to attend the congregation, taking into
consideration the recommended time to pray in. The Prophet((God bless him
and grant him peace))said to Bilal[Make room between the adhan and iqama so
that the one making ablution finishes his need and the one eating finishes his
meal]."
