BOOK II: PRAYER ٢٥٧


prostration and according to others, it is not. Ibn Qayyim said, "It appears from
the prostration made by Ka'ab Ibn Malik that it was customary among the
Companions to make prostrations when they received good tidings." Abu Bakr((God be pleased with him))made this prostration when he was informed of the
murder of Musailamah. Umar((God be pleased with him))prostrated when
Yarmuk was conquered. The Prophet((God bless him and give him peace))also
prostrated several times on such occasions."

Imam an-Nasafy states in his book Al-Kaafy. Whoever recites in the same sitting alll
of the prostration verses with the intention of reciting all of them, and makes one
prostration for each of the recitations, Allah will save him from whatever he is
troubled with[from the matters pertaining to this life and the hereafter, and many
scholars are of this view].
