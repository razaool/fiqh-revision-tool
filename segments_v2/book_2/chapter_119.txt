After this,(the imam and the people are)to pronounce the additional takdirs three
times raising the hands for each one as was done in the first rak'ah; and this
method is superior to advancing the additional takbirs before the recitation, since
it was the practice of Ibn Mas'ud and many of the Companions agreed with his
saying((God be pleased with them all))."

If however, the imam advances the additional takdirs in the second rak'ah before
the recitation, it is permitted. And on completion of the prayer, the imam is to
conduct two sermons during which he is to teach the people the laws pertaining to
sadaqah al-Fitr as the Prophet did((God bless him and give him peace))because
the sermon was sanctioned in order to teach people the laws pertaining to


sadaqah al-Fitr.'

The Ruling Of Missing The Prayer Of Eid Al-Fitr And Delaying It

One cannot make up the prayer of Eid al-Fitr if it is missed in congregation with
the imam, because the conditions of the prayer are incomplete without him.

If there is a reason that the Eid prayer cannot be performed on the proper day,
then it may be delayed and performed on the following day only. For example, if
the moon is veiled or is witnessed after the sun had passed its peak, then it is
permitted the following day only. Another reason could be that the Eid prayer
was performed when it was cloudy after which it became known that the dhuhr
time had entered which meant the Eid prayer was performed in a non-permissible
time.
