٢٧٤ BOOK II: PRAYER


This means that it begins after the faj٧ prayer on the day of Arafah(٩")and ends
after the 'asr on the final day of tashriq(١٣")according to Muhammad and Abu
Yusuf. Note: This is precautionary, because to perform something that is not
required is better than to leave the command of remembering Allah during the
days which are known(ma'lumat)and those which are appointed(ma 'dudat). Allah
said in surah Hajj, verse ٢٢[Remember Allah during the known days]and in
surah al-Baqarah, verse ٢٠٣[Remember Allah during the appointed days]. It is
maintained that the appointed days are the days of tashriq and that the known
days are the first ten days of the month of dhil hijjah. There is another view that
holds that the known days are the days of nahr and the appointed days are the
days of tashrig."


The issue is a matter of disagreement among the Companions. The two jurists
relied on the statements of Ali(God be pleased with Him)adopting the maximum
as that is the precaution taken in matters of worship. Abu Hanifa relied on the
statement of Ibn Mas'ud adopting the minimum as pronouncing the takbir aloud
is an innovation.

The takbir is; Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. There is none worthy of
worship except Allah. Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. All Praise be to
Allah.
