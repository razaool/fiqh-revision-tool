BOOK IV: FASTING ٣٥٥


a pall fe oo fre Sh tal ye SLEW yc pty pal GLE Vy dawually


Rinsing the mouth or nostrils for other than wudu is not disliked and neither is
taking a bath, or dressing in wet cloths to cool down; and the fatwa issued is in
accordance with this view. These practices are not disliked according to Abu
Yusuf, whilst Abu Hanifa held that they are disliked. However, it is the view of
Abu Yusuf which is more widely held on the matter because Abu Dawud
transmitted that the Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))poured water
upon his head while fasting due to thirst or heat." And Ibn Umar would wet his
clothes and wrap himself in them while fasting.'


That Which Is Recommended When Fasting


lew J mr,


There are three things that are recommended for the one observing fast
gi


١- The pre-dawn meal(sahur)is recommended; The Prophet((God bless him and
grant him peace))said[Observe sahur, for verily there is blessing in the sahur].'


oly


٢- To delay the pre-dawn meal to shortly before dawn is recommended. The
Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))said[Three things are from the
qualities of the Messengers: To break the fast immediately(upon sunset), to delay
sahur and to place the right hand over the left hand in prayer]. Note; there are
some people who do not observe the pre-dawn meal, or who observe it too early.
According to moderation, this is not endorsed. The Prophet and his Companions
observed the predawn meal to acquire strength for fasting the day and would
delay the pre-dawn meal to the extent that the time between observing the meal
and dawn was equal to the time one could recite fifty verses.'
