Fortuitous Circumstances
The Ill, The Pregnant And The Breast-Feeding.


The circumstances which are deemed legal and for which no sin is awarded for
the breaking of fast are eight: illness, travel, coercion, pregnancy, breast-feeding,
hunger, thirst and old age. In each of the cases, one is permitted to break or leave
the days of fasting at hand and make up the days later when one is able. For
example: an old and frail man who suffers from an illness is allowed to leave the
fast and pay a fee(fidya). If this person regains strength for fasting, he must make
up the days that he missed. Similarly, Ramadan may be missed in the following
scenarios.

A pregnant or nursing woman is permitted to leave the fast if she fears a loss of
mind, death, or illness upon herself or child(regardless if the child is her own or a
child she nurses). If the fear is present, she is to delay the fast to a later date. The
Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))said[Allah has remitted half the
prayer to a traveller, and fasting to the traveller, the woman who is suckling an
infant and the woman who is pregnant}."
