If a Muslim or Christian finds valuable minerals such as gold, silver or lead in the
kharaj land or in ushr land, whether one finds them in their original form or they
were buried there in the pre-Islamic times in the days of ignorance, it is called
rikaz(treasure trove). Note: ushr land is a land on which zakat is obliged and
kharaj land is that which land tax is levied. Al-Hidayah states that if minerals are


found within a house, then there is no charge on it according to Abu-Hanifa.
Imam Muhammad and Abu Yusuf held that zakat is due regardless.

The wealth(zakat)that results from treasure(and minerals)is to be added with
the animals of the war(booty)and distributed for the general benefit of the
country. This wealth is not to be specifically donated to the poor and unfortunate
persons and neither to all the other types of recipients of zakat because this is for
the general benefit of the nation. This is state capital.

The recipients of zakat are eight as Allah mentioned in His saying[zakat is for
the poor, destitute and helpless, those who are employed to administer the funds,
those whose hearts have been recently reconciled to the truth, for the freeing of a
slave, the one in debt, those fighting for Islam and the way farer].'
