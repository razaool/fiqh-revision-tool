The man is required to pay the(sadaqah of fitr)from his own money for himself,
his young children(who do not have wealth)and for his slave who works in the

The rich child who has money is to have it paid for from that money. And the
insane person takes the ruling of a child, in that if the insane does not possess

recommended to pay the sadagah of fitr after dawn arrives, but before the
performance of the Eid prayer.
