It is sunna for the follower to intend the imam in the side the imam is on.
Meaning if the imam is on the right side of the follower, then he is to intend him
in the salam on the right, and if the imam is on the left side, then the follower is to
intend him in the left salam. If however, the follower is next to the imam, he is to
intend the imam in both the salams, including the people, guardian angels and
pious jinns.

It is sunna for the follower to say his finishing salams together with the salams of
his imam according to Imam Abu Hanifa, while the two jurists maintained that

our prayer with the taslim along with his."

It is sunna for the latecomer to the group prayer to wait until the imam has given
both the finishing salams before making up what he missed. The reason for this is
to ensure that the imam has finalised his prayer and is not going to observe
prostrations of forgetfulness, for the latecomer has no knowledge of this due to his
late arrival.
