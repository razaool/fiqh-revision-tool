To offer prayer in congregation is an emphasized sunna for a free man who has
no valid excuse to be absent. The Prophet((God bless him and grant him peace))said((I planned or was about to order the collecting of firewood and then order
someone to lead prayer, then I would go from behind and burn the houses of men
who did not present themselves for the(prescribed)prayer))." The Prophet((God
bless him and grant him peace))was diligent with respect to the congregational
prayer throughout his whole life and one should not leave it unless there is a valid
reason.

Conditions That Validate The Position Of Imam
Bel ly By Sy Jaally & gly PHY: Lol nn leo Sle JULY de by ٥٥
The conditions that validate the position of imam for a male of sound health are six;


١- Islam. If one rejects the Judgement Day or the Caliphate of Abu Bakr or the
Prophets Companions(God be pleased with them all)or curses or swears at Abu
Bakr and Umar or rejects the intercession of the Prophet and examples as such,
then his position as imam is invalid.


٢- Maturity. The prayer of a boy is considered as a voluntary one even if he is
praying an obligatory prayer.


٣- Sanity. Prayer behind a person with no capacity to discriminate or differentiate
between things is invalid.


٤- Male. It is not permitted for a male to pray behind a hermaphrodite or female.


٥- Recitation of Quran from memory. One must memorise a minimum of three
short verses or one long verse in order to validate his position of imam.
