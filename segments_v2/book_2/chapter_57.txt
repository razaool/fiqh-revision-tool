BOOK II: PRAYER ١٨٩


To turn over(or brush away)a rock is disliked, except if one does so once for

him peace))about the smoothing of a stone, upon which he answered[Once, and
if one left it, it is better for youl."

who earn the anger of Allah].°

Turning the head around by turning the neck is disliked. The Prophet((God bless
him and grant him peace))said[Allah, the Most High, continues to turn
favourably towards a servant while he is engaged in prayer as long as he does not
look to the side(by turning his neck), but if he does so, Allah turns from him].
The Prophet((Peace and blessing be upon him))also said[If only the person
praying knew who he is pleasing when he turns the head].°

Sitting in the style of ig'ah, such as a dog with the buttocks and arms on the
ground and the legs vertical and joined to the chest, is disliked.


Placing the forearms on the ground during prostration is disliked. The Prophet((Peace and blessing of God be upon him))is reported as saying[See that none of
you stretches out his forearms(on the ground)like a dog].°
